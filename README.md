# parkinsonism_detection
This project evaluates the effectiveness of supervised machine learning algorithms to detect Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) using voice data. Algorithms like KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost were tested. Python, along with NumPy and Pandas, was used. XGBoost showed high accuracy for PD detection.
